Online application for hiring tutors and advertising your tutoring services.
"The scope of the project includes creating a web application for hiring tutors. The work will involve implementing functionalities such as adding, browsing, modifying, and deleting advertisements for both teachers and students. Additionally, the application will feature a fast planning and reservation of lessons using a calendar. The application will include a user login and registration system with different access levels. Moreover, students will have the ability to personalize lessons according to their needs by uploading materials to teachers after booking lessons. A database will be created to store information about advertisements, users, and transactions. The project will also encompass a rating system for tutors, lesson management, sending notifications and reminders, as well as generating statistics. The application will also provide a system for assigning interested teachers to student advertisements. The user interface design will consider intuitive browsing, filtering, and hiring of teachers."
